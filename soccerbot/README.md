Overview
--------

This is the 2012 code rewrite for the soccer bots. Our soccer bots run using 
* Arduino
* A custom made soccerbot shield (details will follow)
* Custom made hardware
* Custom wii-pixart sensor board mounted on servo

We are planning on building a few of these in order to introduce robotic principles to kids.
