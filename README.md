rambamrobotics
==============

Overview
--------

This repo contains the rambam robotics team source code. Last year we had a catastrophic loss of code
before the competition so this year we will be using git. 

Depends
-------

This repo depends on a few other libraries:
* i2c - a high speed and optimized i2c/twi library
* i2cperipheral - a library allowing multiplexing and using mulriple i2c/twi peripherals at the same time


Directories
-----------

* Soccerbot - our soccerbot implementation
* Microcopter (to be added) - our firmware for reflashing toy helicopters
* Carduino (to be added) - arduino based car hack code as seen on instructibles
*
